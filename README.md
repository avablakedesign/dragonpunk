- Pages folder is for React Components to render different endpoints for the app.
- Pages /api folder is for server only express.js endpoints.
- If getting errors, probably need to add the right typing to satisfy typescript.
    - check the types folder to understand typescript types.
- In server/models place mongoose models.
- I will set up apollo server with graphql.
